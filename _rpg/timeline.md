## Overview

The Timeline is a mind-twisting Powered by the Apocalypse RPG where you need to think in four dimensions. Unlike other time travel games, The Timeline features one single, consistent timeline that players must navigate and modify carefully.

## Core Concept

**One Timeline. One Reality. Infinite Possibilities.**

Every action in the past affects the present and future. Players must carefully consider the consequences of their temporal interventions while solving problems that span across different time periods.

## Key Features

- **Unified Timeline**: One consistent reality that changes based on player actions
- **PbtA Engine**: Uses the proven Powered by the Apocalypse framework
- **Temporal Mechanics**: Special rules for time travel, paradoxes, and causality
- **Multi-Era Play**: Adventures can span from ancient history to far future
- **Consequence-Driven**: Every change has ripple effects across time

## What Makes It Unique

- **Temporal Thinking**: Players must consider cause and effect across time periods
- **Paradox Management**: Built-in systems for handling temporal paradoxes
- **Historical Integration**: Encourages research and integration of real historical events
- **Collaborative Storytelling**: PbtA mechanics promote shared narrative control
- **Mind-Bending Puzzles**: Challenges that require four-dimensional thinking

## Game Master Advice

- Start with simple time travel scenarios before adding complexity
- Keep a timeline visual aid to track changes
- Embrace the "butterfly effect" - small changes can have big consequences
- Let players discover the rules of time travel through play
- Historical accuracy is less important than dramatic potential

## Development Status

The Timeline is currently in alpha development. This version includes:
- Core time travel mechanics
- Character creation rules
- Sample scenarios
- GM guidance for temporal campaigns

Feedback and playtesting reports are welcome!

## Design Philosophy

"Time travel should be about the weight of choices, not the mechanics of causality. Every decision echoes across time."
